### Hello 👋, I'm Jean Villarreal!

🚀 As a Full Stack Developer from Peru, my journey in software engineering is driven by a 🔥 passion for technology and self-taught enthusiasm. This drive has guided me through the complexities of open source and user-centered development. I excel in creating robust, scalable and high-performance solutions 🛠️, specializing in backend systems with GoLang, JavaScript, NodeJS and various cloud technologies, particularly AWS 🌩️.

Currently, I am weaving magic as a Full Stack Developer 🧙‍♂️, designing, building and maintaining microservices using GoLang, PostgreSql and adopting design patterns such as microservices, event-driven development and SOLID principles. My role also extends to web application maintenance, where I design and refine frontend projects, while adhering to best practices in software development.

My professional career 🌟 has included important positions in leading companies, perfecting my skills in frontend and full-stack technologies. My dedication to software engineering goes beyond simple coding; I am a passionate innovator 💡, committed to pushing the boundaries of technology to improve user experiences.

Beyond code, I am deeply rooted in the tech community, sharing ideas, mentoring, and promoting collaboration 🤝. My objective? Not only creating cutting-edge software, but also inspiring and guiding the next wave of developers with the wisdom gained on my journey.
